        <p>
          Building in public used to scare me. The idea of sharing half-formed
          thoughts, unfinished projects, and imperfect code felt reckless.
        </p>
        <p>
          But over time, I realized something important: clarity comes from
          exposure. When you explain your thinking to others, you refine it
          for yourself.
        </p>
        <h2 className="pt-6 text-2xl font-medium text-secondary">
          Learning compounds faster
        </h2>
        <p>
          Writing forces structure. Structure reveals gaps. Gaps push you to
          learn. This feedback loop is hard to beat.

          long to share it.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Building in public isn’t about validation. It’s about velocity —
          mental, creative, and professional.

      <p>
        Somehow, you’ve landed on this blog post — and that already means more
        than you think. Welcome. This is the first post of a journey I’ve been
        postponing for a long time.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m a full-time student, constantly juggling lectures, assignments, and
        expectations. Alongside that, I spend a lot of time building, learning,
        and figuring things out on my own. For a long while, I felt the urge to
        write — but never gave myself permission to start.
      </p>

      <h2 className="pt-6 text-2xl font-medium text-secondary">
        Why I decided to start
      </h2>

      <p>
        The idea of blogging didn’t come from wanting attention or validation.
        It came from exhaustion — mental exhaustion. Consuming endlessly,
        building quietly, learning in isolation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Writing felt like the missing piece. A place to slow down, reflect, and
        document what I’m learning while I’m still learning it.
      </p>

      <h2 className="pt-6 text-2xl font-medium text-secondary">
        The fear before starting
      </h2>

      <p>
        The hardest part wasn’t writing. It was starting. I kept telling myself
        that the first post had to be perfect — well-written, insightful,
        impressive.
      </p>

      <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-secondary pl-4 italic text-secondary/70">
        Perfection is just fear wearing better clothes.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        I was scared of being judged. Scared that no one would read it. Scared
        that too many people might. So I delayed — again and again.
      </p>

      <p>
        And then one day, I realized something simple: if I wait for confidence,
        I’ll never publish anything.
      </p>

      <h2 className="pt-6 text-2xl font-medium text-secondary">
        What this blog will be about
      </h2>

      <p>
        This blog is not a tutorial dump or a highlight reel. It’s a record of
        growth — messy, honest, and unfinished.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ll write about being a student, building projects, learning new
        technologies, struggling with consistency, and figuring life out one
        step at a time. Some posts will be technical. Some will be personal.
        Most will be somewhere in between.
      </p>

      <h2 className="pt-6 text-2xl font-medium text-secondary">
        A promise to myself
      </h2>

      <p>
        This blog is a commitment — not to perfection, but to progress. To show
        up even when I don’t feel ready. To write even when my thoughts feel
        incomplete.
      </p>

      <p>
        If this journey helps even one person feel less alone in their own
        process, it will be worth it. And if nothing else, it will remind me how
        far I’ve come when I look back.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thanks for being here — at the very beginning. I’ll see you in the next
        post.

  excerpt:
    "Third year is where excitement fades and fear kicks in. Career pressure, comparisons, and uncertainty — this is my honest take on dealing with it.",
  date: "Feb 6, 2026",

      <p>
        If you’re a third-year B.Tech student reading this, chances are you
        already know what I’m talking about. The silent pressure. The constant
        comparison. The fear that creeps in late at night when everything goes
        quiet.
      </p>

      <p>
        My name is Shivankar, and I study at Madan Mohan Malaviya University of
        Technology. Somewhere between semesters, deadlines, and career talks,
        I realized that third year doesn’t just test your skills — it tests your
        mental strength.
      </p>

      <h2 className="pt-6 text-2xl font-medium text-secondary">
        Why third year hits the hardest
      </h2>

      <p>
        First year is curiosity. Second year is experimentation. Third year is
        reality.
      </p>

      <p>
        Suddenly, everyone is talking about placements, internships, packages,
        higher studies, and “backup plans.” You start questioning your choices,
        your pace, and sometimes even your worth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Watching others seem confident while you feel stuck can slowly turn
        motivation into self-doubt — and self-doubt into something heavier.
      </p>

      <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-secondary pl-4 italic text-secondary/70">
        Depression doesn’t always scream. Sometimes it just whispers,
        “You’re running out of time.”
      </blockquote>

      <h2 className="pt-6 text-2xl font-medium text-secondary">
        The invisible signs we ignore
      </h2>

      <p>
        It’s not always dramatic. Sometimes it’s losing interest in things you
        once loved. Sometimes it’s procrastination that comes from fear, not
        laziness. Sometimes it’s smiling in front of friends while feeling
        completely empty inside.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve felt all of it — the burnout, the confusion, the pressure to “figure
        everything out” before graduation.
      </p>

      <h2 className="pt-6 text-2xl font-medium text-secondary">
        How I’m learning to counter it
      </h2>

      <p>
        I don’t have a perfect solution — but I’m learning. Slowly.
      </p>

      <p>
        First, I stopped pretending that I have everything under control.
        Accepting that it’s okay to feel lost was strangely freeing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Second, I started focusing on controllables — learning one skill,
        building one project, improving one habit at a time. Progress doesn’t
        have to be loud to be real.
      </p>

      <p>
        And finally, I began talking — to friends, to myself, through writing.
        Suppressing emotions only makes them heavier.
      </p>

      <h2 className="pt-6 text-2xl font-medium text-secondary">
        A message to my fellow third-years
      </h2>

      <p>
        You are not behind. You are not broken. You are not failing just because
        you feel uncertain.
      </p>

      <p>
        This phase is uncomfortable because it matters. Growth rarely feels
        peaceful while it’s happening.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re struggling, know this — you’re not weak for feeling this way.
        You’re human. And you’re allowed to take your time.
      </p>

      <p>
        We’ll figure it out — one step, one decision, one day at a time.

      <p>
        For the longest time, I thought being an “average student” was safe.
        No expectations, no pressure, no risk of failure. Just survive exams,
        submit assignments, move on.
      </p>

      <p>
        My name is Shivankar, and somewhere during my B.Tech journey at Madan
        Mohan Malaviya University of Technology, I realized something uncomfortable:
        average wasn’t peaceful — it was suffocating.
      </p>

      <h2 className="pt-6 text-2xl font-medium text-secondary">
        The silent trap of being average
      </h2>

      <p>
        Being average doesn’t hurt immediately. That’s the problem.
      </p>

      <p>
        You attend classes, score just enough, and convince yourself that
        “everyone is like this.” But deep down, there’s a quiet voice saying
        you could do more — and ignoring it slowly builds regret.
      </p>

      <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-secondary pl-4 italic text-secondary/70">
        Comfort doesn’t kill dreams instantly. It kills them slowly.
      </blockquote>

      <h2 className="pt-6 text-2xl font-medium text-secondary">
        The moment it hit me
      </h2>

      <p>
        It wasn’t a single failure. It was a pattern.
      </p>

      <p>
        Watching others build skills, take risks, and talk passionately about
        what they were learning — while I kept waiting for “the right time.”
        That’s when I knew the real enemy wasn’t lack of talent.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was hesitation.
      </p>

      <h2 className="pt-6 text-2xl font-medium text-secondary">
        What not being average actually means
      </h2>

      <p>
        It doesn’t mean topping every exam. It doesn’t mean knowing everything.
      </p>

      <p>
        For me, it meant taking ownership. Studying not just to pass, but to
        understand. Building things even when I felt underprepared. Asking
        questions even when I felt stupid.
      </p>

      <p>
        It meant choosing progress over approval.
      </p>

      <h2 className="pt-6 text-2xl font-medium text-secondary">
        Small shifts that changed everything
      </h2>

      <p>
        I stopped waiting for motivation and started working with discipline.
        Some days were boring. Some days were frustrating. But consistency
        quietly built confidence.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also stopped comparing my Chapter 1 to someone else’s Chapter 10.
        That comparison game keeps most students average forever.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead, I focused on becoming slightly better than yesterday — and
        let time do the rest.
      </p>

      <h2 className="pt-6 text-2xl font-medium text-secondary">
        To anyone who feels stuck like I did
      </h2>

      <p>
        You don’t need to reinvent yourself overnight. You don’t need to be
        extraordinary tomorrow.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just stop lying to yourself about what you want. Start showing up.
        Start failing forward. Start before you feel ready.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m still on this journey. I’m still figuring things out. But one thing
        is clear — I no longer want to live a life where I wonder,
        “What if I had tried?”
      </p>

      <p>
        And that, for me, is how not being average begins.
